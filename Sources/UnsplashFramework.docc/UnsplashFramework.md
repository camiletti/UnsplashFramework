# ``UnsplashFramework``

Easy-to-use, well tested and well documented client framework for Unsplash.

## Overview

Start by instantiating a ``UNClient`` with your Unsplash API key and secret using ``UNCredentials``. 

Search photos, collections and users by providing your main query and optional filters such as orientation or collections for photos. Manage the amount of results by providing the page and amount of results per page.
