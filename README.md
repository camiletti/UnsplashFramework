## üì∑ Introduction
The idea behind this project is to make an easy-to-use, well tested and well documented client framework for Unsplash.

> Currently in early development stage üçº


## üõ† Plan
- [x] List photos
- [x] Fetching images
- [ ] List collections
- [ ] Search
- [ ] Users


## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

Coming soon


## üéõ Use

### Credentials

Before doing any request, Unsplash client credentials should be set. If you haven't registed yet, you can do so [here](https://unsplash.com/developers).

```swift
UNClient.shared.setAppID("Your_AppID", secret: "Your_Secret")
```


### Listing photos


```swift
UNClient.shared.listPhotos(page: 1, photosPerPage: 10, sortingBy: .popular) { (photos, error) in

    if let error = error {
        print("Error: \(error.reason)")
        return
    }
    
    photos.forEach({ (photo) in
        print("Photo with ID: \(photo.id) from user: \(photo.user.username) main color: \(photo.hexColor)")
    })
}
```


### Fetching the image of a photo and setting it to an UIImageView

For better performance and network utilization, a UNPhoto holds all the information of a photo except the image. The image of the photo can be requested independently in 5 size (raw, full, regular, small and thumb). Using the following UIImageView function will take care of the network request and setting the image as soon as it is downloaded. The main color of the photo can be set as the background while the request is in progress.

```swift
let imageView = UIImageView()
imageView.backgroundColor = photo.color

imageView.setImage(from: photo, inSize: .small)
```


### Fetching the image of a photo

```swift
let imageView = UIImageView()

self.client.fetchImage(from: samplePhoto,
                       inSize: .full) { (requestedPhoto, requestedSize, image, error) in

    if let error = error {
        print("Error: \(error.reason)")
        return
    }
    
    imageView.image = image
}
```
