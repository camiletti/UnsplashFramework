                                         sortingBy: .popular)
```

```swift
// Searching photos
let photos = try await client.searchPhotos(query: "forest",
                                           page: 1,
                                           photosPerPage: 10,

                                           orientation: .landscape)

// Searching collections
let collections = try await client.searchCollections(query: "jungle",
                                                     page: 1,
                                                     collectionsPerPage: 10)

// Searching for users
let users = try await client.searchUsers(query: "camiletti",
                                         page: 1,
                                         usersPerPage: 10)
