                  photosPerPage: 10,
                  sortingBy: .popular)
    { result in
        switch result {
        case .success(let photos):
            photos.forEach({ (photo) in
                print("Photo with ID: \(photo.id) from user: \(photo.user.username) main color: \(photo.hexColor)")
            })

        case .failure(let error):
            print("Error: \(error.reason)")
    }
}
```


### Searching photos

client.searchPhotos(query: "Forest",
                    page: 1,
                    photosPerPage: 10,
                    collections: nil,
                    orientation: .landscape)
    { result in
        switch result {
        case .success(let searchResult):
        searchResult.photos.forEach { (photo) in
            print("Photo with ID: \(photo.id) from user: \(photo.user.username) main color: \(photo.hexColor)")
        }
        
        case .failure(let error):
            print("Error: \(error.reason)")
        }
